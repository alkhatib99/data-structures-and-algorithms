# Linkedlist - Zip

Zip two linked lists

---

## Challenge

Write a function called Zip Linkedlists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

## Approach & Efficiency

With 2 pointers keeping tracking of the current position outside the while loop and two pointers inside the while loop (temp) keeping track of the next.
Then, I move the current nodes next to zip them together
