## Refresh of Time and Space Complexity

Sometimes, there  are more than one way to solve the problem.

So, we need to learn how to compare the performance different alfgoeithms and choose the best one to solve a particular problem.

Time and space complexity depends on lots of things like hardware, operating system, processors, etc.

### Start with a somple example

Suppose you are give an array `A` and an integer `x` and you have to find if `x` exists in array `A`.

Simple solution to this problem is traverse the whole array  and check if the any element is equal to.

```code
for i : 1 to length of A
    if A[i] is equal to x
        return TRUE
return FALSE
```
