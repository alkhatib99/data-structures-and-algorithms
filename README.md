### Challenege 1 - Reverse Array

#### Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

#### Solution

### Challenege 2 - Insert and Shift Array

#### Challenge

Write a function called ```insertShiftArray``` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### Solution

*[The Sol:](/array-insert-shift/README.md)*

### Challenege 3 - Array Binary Search

#### Challenge

Function called `binary_search`
 which takes 2 parameters:

* first is a sorted array
* second is the search key.

Return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key
     or -1 if the element is not in the array.

### Challenege 5 - Linked-list

#### Challenge

how to used linkedlist ot inser element and check if is exist or not

#### Solution

### Challenege 6 - Link List - Append,Insert before, Insert After
Write methods that appends an node to the end of the link list, inserts a new node before a specific value and one that inserts a new node after a specific value.


[THE-PR]()

- `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list
- `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately before the first `value` node
- `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
