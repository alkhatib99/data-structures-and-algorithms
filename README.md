### Challenege 1 - Reverse Array

#### Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

### Challenge 2 - Insert and Shift Array

#### Challenge

Write a function called ```insertShiftArray``` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Challenege 3 - Array Binary Search

#### Challenge

A function called `binary_search`
 which takes 2 parameters:

- first is a sorted array
- the second is the search key.

Return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key
     or -1 if the element is not in the array.

### Challenege 5 - Linked-list

#### Challenge

how to use LinkedList to insert elements and check if it is exist or not

---

#### Solution

*[The Sol:](./linked-list/README.md)*

---

#### Whiteboard

> There is no whiteboard for this solution.

---

### Challenge 6 - LinkedList - Append,Insert before, Insert After

#### Challenge

Write methods that append a node to the end of the link list, insert a new node before a specific value, and one that inserts a new node after a specific value.

- `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list

- `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given `newValue` immediately before the first `value` node

- `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

### Challenege 7 - LinkedList - kth from end

---

#### Challenge

Create a  function that returns the node's value that is k places fro teh tail of linked list.

---

#### Solution

### Challenge 8 - Linkedlist - Zip

#### Challenge

Write a function called Zip Linkedlists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
